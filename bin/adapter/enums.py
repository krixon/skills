"""Neutral enum vocabularies and the mapping helper, per ADR 0009.

Every enum a skill branches on is a closed, lower-snake, documented vocabulary;
each backend maps its native values *in*, and an unmapped native value is an
error, not a pass-through. `map_enum` is the generic helper — a native→neutral
table plus a raise-on-miss guard — that the per-enum mappers (`issue_state`
here, review decision and merge state in later slices) are built on.

The maps live here, beside the helper, so the neutral vocabulary is legible in
one place and a new backend adds a row rather than a branch.
