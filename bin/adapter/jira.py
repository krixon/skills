"""The `acli`-backed Jira implementation of the tracker concepts, per ADR 0008.

Sibling of the `GithubBackend` in `tracker.py` and symmetric with it: the same
tracker-neutral concept surface, mapped to Jira primitives rather than GitHub
ones. It shells out to `acli jira` for everything acli can do, and makes exactly
one urllib REST call — `aclicmd.fetch_transitions` — for the one thing acli
cannot: enumerate an issue's reachable transitions.

The concept→primitive map (ADR 0008): category and structure labels become Jira
issue types, the workflow/triage state labels carry across as Jira labels, and
the execution/closure states resolve through the platform-stable status category
rather than a status name. The issue id is an opaque string (the Jira key); the
branch name is the truth-of-record link, and the key rides the PR title's
Conventional-Commits description — both owned by the skills that consume this
backend, not by the mechanics here.

The category invariant (ADR 0008): a status is *read* by its
`statusCategory.key` (`new` / `indeterminate` / `done`), never by name, because
the key is platform-stable while a project can rename "In Progress" freely. A
status *transition* resolves the target category to a concrete reachable status
name at call time via the /transitions fetch, then transitions by that name —
so a workflow rename can never break the binding to a hard-coded name.
